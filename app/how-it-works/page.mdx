## VODs

BazaarGhost only processes publicly available Twitch VODs.

When there's a VOD by a streamer that BazaarGhost hasn't seen before, it checks their backlog for any other Bazaar streams and queues them for processing.

## Username Detection

Matchup screens last 5-6 seconds, which means I only need to check 1 frame every 5 seconds, since it's guaranteed that I'll catch a matchup frame when there is one.

  <div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center gap-6">

        alt="nameplate"
        className="rounded-lg shadow-md"
        width={300}
        height={80}
      />
      <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">Original nameplate</p>
    </div>
    <div className="text-center">
      <Image
        src="/ocr_nameplate.webp"
        alt="OCR processed nameplate text"
        className="rounded-lg shadow-md"
        width={200}
        height={60}

After finding a matchup screen, Tesseract (OCR engine) reads text from the preprocessed nameplate region.

All detected usernames are:

- Stored with timestamps and VOD links
- Indexed for search
- Available only while the source VOD remains public\*

## Confidence Score

The confidence score represents how certain the OCR system is that it correctly read a username. Higher scores mean the text was clear and easy to read, while lower scores suggest the text might have been blurry or partially obscured.

## Streamers

**Once a day**, BazaarGhost checks Twitch for recent Bazaar streams. If there's a VOD from a new streamer that isn't in the database, that streamer gets added.

#### Note

Some streamers may have fewer results because of low confidence text extraction. This is usually because their camera either partially or fully covers the nameplate region on screen, or there are other UI elements blocking it.

## Working on it

- Real-time or near-real-time matchup detections
- Get notified when your username is detected
- Improved username detection

\*VOD availability is updated hourly. It is possible to get search results for unavailable VODs within that one-hour window after a VOD gets delisted.
