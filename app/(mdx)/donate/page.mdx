The support for Bazaar Ghost has been overwhelmingly positive, and already **thousands** have visited the site. While that is awesome,
it does mean that running the site will cost more than I initially predicted for what was a little hobby/side project.

As a certified ad-hater, I'd rather avoid going down that route for as long as possible. Donating to my Ko-fi helps me cover operational
costs while keeping the site ad-free.

Since you're reading this, thank you for even considering to tip--Bazaar Ghost is a free community tool, and any donation will be put right
back into the costs of running and improving the site.
