I go by Liftaris online, Kaio otherwise.

I built this site as a fun project, and to scratch an itch I and many other Bazaar players have to see their ghosts beyond their own runs.

Best place to reach me is through the <Link className="text-accent" href="https://discord.gg/a5wRFRe6m3">Bazaar Ghost Discord</Link>

You can also send me an email at <span className="text-accent">liftaris@gmail.com</span>
