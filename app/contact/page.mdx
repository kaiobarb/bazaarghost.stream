## Contact

I go by Liftaris online, Kaio otherwise.

I built this site as a fun project, and to scratch an itch I and many other Bazaar players have to see their ghosts beyond their own runs.

Best place to reach me is through the [BazaarGhost Discord](https://discord.gg/a5wRFRe6m3).

You can also send me an email at liftaris@gmail.com
